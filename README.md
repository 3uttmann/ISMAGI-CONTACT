# ISMAGI-CONTACT
ISMAGI-CONTACT is a single-page web application (SPA) to manage a contact list (CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete). The application will interact with a simple RESTful API that will store data in a server-side db.json file. This project aims to consolidate mastery of fundamental and advanced Vue.js concepts.
